Implement a function that takes as input three variables, and returns the largest of the three. 
Do this without using the Python max() function!

Solution:

number1 = int(input("Enter 1st variable"));
number2 = int(input("Enter 2nd variable"));
number3 = int(input("Enter 3rd variable"));

if number1 > number2 and number1 > number3:
    print(str(number1) + " is greater amongst the three variables");
elif number2 > number1 and number2 > number3:
    print(str(number2) + " is greater amongst the three variables");
else:
    print(str(number3) + " is greater amongst the three variables");
