Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not. (A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

Solution: 
word = input("Enter a string");
reversed_word = word[::-1];

if word == reversed_word:
    print("The string you entered is a palindrome");
else:
    print("The string you entered is not a palindrome");
