Make a two-player Rock-Paper-Scissors game. (Hint: Ask for player plays (using input), compare them, print out a message of congratulations to the winner, and ask if the players want to start a new game)

Remember the rules:

Rock beats scissors
Scissors beats paper
Paper beats rock

Solution: 
print("Welcome to the game of rock, paper, scissors");
print("This is a two player game!. Now lets start the game");
answer = 'y';

while answer != 'n':
    print("Rock! Paper! Scissors!")
    player1 = input("Player1! Enter your choice ");
    player1 = player1.lower();
    player2 = input("Player2! Enter your choice ");
    player2 = player2.lower();

    if (player1 == "rock" and player2 == "scissors") or (player1 == "scissors" and player2 == "paper") or (player1 == "paper" and player2 == "rock"):
            print("Player1 ! You won the game");
    else:
            print("Player2 ! You won the game");

    answer = input("Do you want to continue the game? If yes, enter 'y' else enter 'n'");
