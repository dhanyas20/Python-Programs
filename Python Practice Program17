    open_file.write("Hello");
    open_file.close();


# to read
with open('new.txt','r') as open_file:

    # to read specific number of characters
    lines = open_file.readline(15);
    print(lines);
    
    # to read the whole file by lines
    lines = open_file.readlines();
    print(lines);
    
    open_file.close();
