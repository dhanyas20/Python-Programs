Take a list, say for example this one:

  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
and write a program that prints out all the elements of the list that are less than 5.

Extras:

Ask the user for a number and return a list that contains only elements from the original list a that are smaller than that number given by the user.

Solution:

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]

for elem in a:
	if elem < 5:
		print(elem)

	
number = int(input("Enter a number as a maximum threshold value to print the elements from the list"))
for elem in a:
	if elem < number:
		print(elem)
