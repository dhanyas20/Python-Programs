Ask the user for a number and determine whether the number is prime or not. (For those who have forgotten, a prime number is a number that has no divisors.). 

Solution: 

def primenumber(number):
    for i in range(2,number):
    if number%i == 0:
         return 0;
    return 1;

number = int(input("Enter a number"));
answer = primenumber(number);

if answer == 0:
    print("The number you entered is not a prime number");
else:
    print("The number you entered is a prime number");
