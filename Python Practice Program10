Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. For practice, write this code inside a function.

Solution:

def frst_last_element(a):
  b.append(a[0]);
  b.append(a[-1]);

a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25];
b = [];
frst_last_element(a);

print(b);
