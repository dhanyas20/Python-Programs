Given two .txt files that have lists of numbers in them, find the numbers that are overlapping.

Solution:

numbers1 = [];
numbers2 = [];

with open('file1.txt','r') as openfile:
    numbers1 = openfile.read();

with open('file2.txt','r') as openfile: 
    numbers2 = openfile.read();
    
numbers1 = numbers1.split("\n");
numbers2 = numbers2.split("\n");

common = [];

for num in numbers1:
    if num in numbers2:
        common.append(num);

print(common);
