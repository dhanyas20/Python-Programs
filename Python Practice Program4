Create a program that asks the user for a number and then prints out a list of all the divisors of that number. 

Solution:

number = int(input("Enter a number"));
lst = []

for i in range(1,number+1):
	if number%i == 0:
		lst.append(i);

print("The divisors the of the number " + str(number) + " are: ");
print(lst)
