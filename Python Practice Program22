You, the user, will have in your head a number between 0 and 100. The program will guess a number, and you, the user, will say whether it is too high, too low, or your number.

At the end of this exchange, your program should print out how many guesses it took to get your number.

Solution:

print("Think of a number between 1 to 100");
print("I shall try to guess it");

count = 0;
answer = 'n';

min = 1;
max = 100;

while(answer == 'n'):
    guess = (max + min) // 2;
    print("Is the number " + str(guess) + "?");
    answer = input("Give 'y' for the correct guess and 'n' for wrong guess");
    count += 1;
    if(answer == 'n'):
        clue = input("If wrong guess, let me know if the number you have thought of is lesser(l) or greater(g) than my guess");
    else:
        print("Yay !I guesssed the number in " + str(count)+ " guesses");
        break;

    if clue == 'g':
        min = guess;
    else:
        max = guess;
