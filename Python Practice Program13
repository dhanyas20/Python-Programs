Write a program (using functions!) that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. 

Solution: 

sentence = input("Enter a sentence");
words = sentence.split();
words.reverse();
sentence = " ".join(words);
print(sentence);
