Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9). Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right. (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

Extras: 
Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

Solution: 

import random
print("Welcome! I shall think of a number between 1 to 10. You have to guess the number");
print("You can take as many guesses you want, but lesser the guesses, more the talented!!");
print("I shall give hint for your every guess. To stop or discontinue in between enter 'exit'");

number = random.randint(1,10);
answer = 'y';
count = 0

while answer != 'n':
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess"));
    count += 1;
    if guess < number:
        print(str(guess) + " is lesser than the number");
    elif guess > number: 
        print(str(guess) + " is greater than the number");
    else:
        print("Yay! You have guessed the number");
        print("You took " + str(count) + " number of guessed to guess the secret number");
        break;
    answer = input("Do you want to continue your guess ? give 'y' or 'n'");
